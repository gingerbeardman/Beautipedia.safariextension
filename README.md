Beautipedia.safariextension
===========================

## Overview

Beautipedia is a Safari Extension that gives Wikipedia a cleaner, tidier, more design focussed look and feel.

It was created by David Ben Jones and its website is at: [http://www.davidbenjones.com/beautipedia/](http://www.davidbenjones.com/beautipedia/)

David was kind enough to open source the code so it can be improved by the community.
