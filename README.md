## Credits

It was created by David Ben Jones, who was kind enough to open source the code so it can be improved by the community. David's website is no longer active, so I have taken over hosting the extension. 

Sadly there was no way to transition existing users of the plugin. Please install this new version manually. From that point on Safari will be aware of all future updates.
